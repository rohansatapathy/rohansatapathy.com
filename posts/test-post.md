Here is the first paragraph of text. It's really really really long to test
out the spacing in the following header 2. What else should I write here?
I'm not really sure, maybe I should just keep yapping in the hopes that this
paragraph ends up long enough.

## Header 2

Here is some text under the header 2.

Here is a paragraph of text.

Here is a code block.

```{.python linenums="1"}
import os
from time import sleep

CONSTANT_VARIABLE = 5.6

# This line is a comment
print("Hello, world!")

class MyClass:
    def __init__(self) -> None:
        """Construct a MyClass."""
        self.hello = "world"

    def __in__(self, thing: str) -> bool:
        """Check whether something is in this class."""
        return thing in self.hello

@some.decorator()
def some_function() -> bool:
    1 + 2 == 3

my_var = some_function()
```

## Another Header 2

Here is a math equation in inline mode: \(y = mx + b\).

Here is a math equation in display mode. 

\[x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\]

```math
\vec{y} = \sum_{n = 0}^{\infty} a_n x^n
```

Here is some inline code stuffs `:::py print("Hello, world!")`.
